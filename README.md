# Demo Monkey Patching in Ruby

This repo accompanies my [blog post](https://blog.dennisokeeffe.com/blog/2022-02-17-the-beginners-guide-to-monkey-patching-in-ruby) on basic monkey patching.

## Getting started

```s
$ bundler install
$ bundler exec -- rspec spec/monkey_patching_spec.rb
```

Uncomment `binding.pry` in the test file if you wish to play around with the monkey-patched subject.
